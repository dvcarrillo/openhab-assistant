# Google AIY Voice Kit and openHAB 2
This script is an adaptation of the ones that come with the 
[Google AIY Voice Kit](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/), including custom commands
that can be sent to openHAB 2, so you can manage your smart home directly from your Voice Kit.

This example is made over a system with a Philips Hue color bulb and makes use of the openHAB
REST API. Adding more Hue lights is as easy as specifying their Items at the Configuration part
of the script. If you would like to add more devices, it is possible by adding new rules,
following the structure of the current script.

*This work is part of my BSc End Project (TFG) about the creation of a voice-driven controller
for home automation on Raspberry Pi*
